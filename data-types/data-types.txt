Data Types:
        Data types are declarations for variables. This determines the type and size of data associated with variable which is essential to know since different data types occupy different size of memory.

There are 2 types of Data Types:
      -Primitive Data Types: to stome simple values
      -Non-primitive Data Types: to store complex values

1. Primitive Data Types:
      There are the data types of fixed size.
      

DataType         Meaning                          Size(in Bytes)     Range
byte         2’s complement integer                   1          -128 to 127
short        2’s complement integer                   2          -32K to 32K
int            Integer numbers                        4           -2B to 2B
long         2’s complement integer(larger values)    8      -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float          Floating-point                         4          Upto 7 decimal digits
double       Double Floating-point                    8          Upto 16 decimal digits
char           Character                              2          a, b, c .. A, B, C .. @, #, $ ..
bool           Boolean                                1          True, false


2. Non-primitive Data Types:
      There are of variable size and are usually declared with a 'new' keyword
      eg: String, Array


Constants
      A constant is a variable in Java which has a fixed value i.e. it cannot be assigned a different value once assigned.

      e.g. : final float PI = 3.14F;

      'final' keyword is used to make a variable constant.
